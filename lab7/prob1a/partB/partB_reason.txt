Problem: Equals method is not override in Employee object.
List.contains checks the equals method of the object. So we need to override equals method and check necessary condition.
Before, equals method was not override, rather than checking its attributes, it was checking object. So, it was giving false.

Solution: Overriding equals method, and checking name and salary of object to determine if object is same or not.
