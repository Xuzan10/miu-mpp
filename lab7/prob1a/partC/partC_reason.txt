Problem: hashcode is not override in Employee class.
Hashmap.containsKey checks the both equals and hashCode of the object. So we need to override equals and hashcode both.
Hashcode helps in identification of an object by keeping object in index, so, before it was not override,
 thus hashmap couldn't determine the object is equal or not.

Solution: Override hashcode in Employee class and add necessary code.
